# hello-world
Learning to use github 
<p>
  
This is some text in the readme branch that I'm typing in github itself after clicking the pencil symbol. 
These change are made to the readme.md file. After that I'm gonna hit commit changes at the bottom, which will save this text added to the readme file of the briford2/hello-world project under the readme-edits branch on github.
